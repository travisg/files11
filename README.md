# Files-11 ODS-2 Disk Image Parser

A quick and dirty FILES-11 ODS-2 disk image parser. 

Currently opens and parses a disk image and walks the directory structure, but not much else.

There's lots to do:
* Open raw devices instead of disk image files
* Dump the entire disk structure to a local directory
* Internal shell to interactively inspect the contents
* Modifying files in place
  * Built in editor?
* Writing and adding new files to the disk image
* Handling ODS-1 and/or ODS-5 images
